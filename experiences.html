								<p> Instead of providing resume bullet-points of my experiences, I thought it would be much more interesting to give small 
                                    anecdotes about my experiences and lessons I've learned through them. I have categorized my experiences into three different segments.
                                    My exposure within all of these segments has given me a unique perspective to problem solving and critical thinking. </p>
                                
                                <h2>Data/Problem Solving Experience</h2>
              
								<p>During my internship in data analytics, I worked with the Department of Student Success at The University of Tennessee to find ways to increase positive career outcomes. I took charge of various responsibilities, including data cleaning, visualization creation, and acquiring new skills like web scraping and HTML proficiency. Data cleaning, while tedious, proved to be the cornerstone of ensuring accurate and reliable analyses. The practice I gained crafting visualizations helped develop my storytelling abilities, enabling me to convey complex information in a digestible manner.  Learning skills such as web scraping and HTML has allowed me to think and problem-solve in more creative ways by providing more ways to gather and handle data.</p>
								<p>One of the most exciting aspects of this internship was that I was the first person to undertake this role. It required resilience, adaptability, and a proactive approach to learning. Navigating uncharted territories meant there were no predefined pathways or established protocols to follow. However, this type of environment helped me grow, pushing me to go beyond my comfort zone, innovate, and find a place within the Student Success Department. It was a testament to my dedication and determination to excel in this role, setting a precedent for future interns. </p>
								<p>This internship experience reaffirmed my decision to pursue studies in business analytics. Moving forward, I am excited to continue developing my skills, exploring new technologies, and contributing to the ever-evolving world of data analytics. It is a journey I eagerly anticipate, and I am driven by genuine enthusiasm.  </p>

                                <h2>Customer Service Experience</h2>
								<p> Throughout my high school and college years, I have cultivated a wide variety of customer service skills across various industries. I worked as a barista, a valet driver, an event server,  a peer mentor, and a children’s fitness instructor. Each role has given me an opportunity to interact with different kinds of customers and I learned to adapt to multiple kinds of environments. Most recently, as a barista, I practiced the art of multitasking in a fast-paced environment.  </p>
								<p> The most challenging part of being a barista was sustaining the emotional resilience to ensure each customer encounter was positive. This role requires meticulous attention to detail, efficiency, and a consistently friendly demeanor. Managing unhappy customers while being overwhelmed with a continued influx of orders allowed me to learn to remain composed amid chaos. Doing this for hours a day was extremely taxing, mentally and physically. Nonetheless, navigating such challenges taught me to maintain an amiable disposition amid adversity, which is a skill transferable to many other areas of my life. My time as a barista gave me the opportunity to develop the acumen to uphold optimism and devise logical solutions in the face of chaos.  </p>
								<p> As a valet driver, I refined my communication skills by learning how to deliver exceptional service and maintain a high level of professionalism. The most challenging aspect of this role was that I was the only woman valet driver at my company. One prominent obstacle was the stereotypes and preconceptions regarding my capabilities as a woman in this role, which made me feel like I had to consistently prove myself in order to gain recognition. Although this was initially daunting, this role ultimately fostered a profound sense of empowerment and self-assurance. </p>
								<p> In my role as an event server, I gained invaluable insights into the orchestration required to create truly memorable experiences. Primarily engaged in serving weddings, I acquired expertise in establishing a seamless flow throughout these special occasions. This role involved the execution of tasks during the event itself, but also extensive preparatory and concluding efforts. Above all, the most important lesson I learned through this role is that people inherently desire acknowledgement. Understanding this simple fact prompted a heightened awareness of the significance of attentive service and adeptly addressing special requests. This realization has become a guiding principle in all my endeavors, leading me to consistently prioritize individuals feeling seen and understood. Implementing this mindset has notably enhanced the quality of my personal and professional relationships.  </p>
								<p> In my roles as a peer mentor and a children’s fitness instructor, I practiced my public speaking abilities. Serving as a peer mentor involved delivering lessons to the class and conducting individual conferences to support students in their first-year endeavors. Similarly, as a fitness instructor, I led groups ranging in size from fifteen to thirty children, spanning ages one to ten years old. Here, I assumed the responsibility of orchestrating multiple activities and providing clear instruction. Both roles challenged me in various ways, yet they collectively helped the development of my communication skills and instilled a deeper empathy for accommodating various learning styles.  </p>
								<p> Experiencing diverse work environments has instilled in me a strong work ethic, effective communication skills, and a collaborative mindset, which enables me to approach problems from multiple perspectives and drive impactful outcomes in any role I undertake in the future. </p>
								<h2>International Experience</h2>
								<p>I will always remember the summer I spent interning in Stockholm. I worked for a company called Comintelli, a market and competitive intelligence company that sells a SaaS platform. Working in marketing the whole summer, I spent most days conducting market research and creating content for different customer profiles. </p>
								<p>One of the most challenging, yet important, parts of my learning experience in Stockholm was that I was put in situations where I “failed”. Not failure to a serious degree, but enough so that I felt that feeling of defeat. I learned that it is okay to fail. In the past, I have struggled with going out of my comfort zone because I want to be great at everything I do. In Stockholm, I got completely thrown out of the categories where I excelled and got thrown into new ones where I had no skills. Despite encountering significant challenges, I am profoundly appreciative of the experiences as they have significantly enhanced my adaptability and innovation.</p>
								<p>Among many great things about Comintelli, I valued the collaborative and inclusive atmosphere cultivated among colleagues. I particularly appreciated the egalitarian culture, evident in the CEO's approachable demeanor during company meetings. His willingness to engage directly with me, seek my input, and treat me as an integral part of the team instilled a sense of belonging and encouraged active participation. While initially challenging, the experience of being put on the spot during discussions facilitated personal growth, enhancing my confidence and readiness to contribute substantially to discussions and offer constructive insights.</p>
