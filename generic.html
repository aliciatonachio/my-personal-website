								<h2>Generative Art</h2>
								<p>Generative art is artwork that is created in part by algorithmically generating forms, shapes, and/or colors. A human can collaborate with a computer to create some really beuatiful creations. In generative art, a human sets rules that creates boundaries for the creation process, and a computer program follows these boundaries to serve as the "paintbrush" and create the art. </p>
								<p>I enjoy creating art in R because R provides a variety of packages and libraries for data visualization and graphics. I use R's capabilities to manipulate shapes, colors, and patterns to create interesting things to look at. My style is more absotract than literal, and I enjoy playing around with different parameters to see how vastly the art changes. One specific type of art I enjoy is using randomness to create a series of polygons. I alter the number of edges, iterations, curvature, angles, colors, weights, and transparency of polygons, and then I use R to randomly plot these polygons. Through experimenting with many variations, I have been able to create some pretty cool things!  </p>
								<h2>Enjoy Some of My Creations</h2>
								<p>These pieces were created using an element of randomness. It's fun to tweak small aspects of the code to see the changes in the art.</p>
