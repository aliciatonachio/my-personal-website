									<h2>Marketplace Simulation (March - May 2024) </h2>
									<p>In the marketplace simulation game, the goal was to become the top-performing bike company by achieving the highest overall score on the balanced scorecard, which measured market performance, marketing effectiveness, and financial performance. In a team of five students from my class, we acted as the executive team of a bike company entering a new and niche market. We competed against other teams in the class within this simulated market. The simulation spanned six quarters, and in each quarter, we had to strategize to increase our cumulative market score. Through this project, I learned how to analyze key market data, collaborate with a team with conflicting priorities, and explore strategic marketing in an evolving situation. </p>

									<h2>Main Driver Analysis (Dec 2023 - Jan 2024)</h2>
								<p> The goal of the project was to maximize the likelihood of alumni donating to The University of Tennessee. In this project, I identified the main drivers that predict whether an alumnus will donate in a given year and recommended which types of alumni to target. I developed a random forest model to predict alumni donations with 94.3% accuracy. I used variable importance plots, partial dependence plots, and variable breakdown plots to determine the key drivers of the prediction. In the executive summary, I made recommendations for the Development Office and described the methodologies used to arrive at these recommendations. </p>

                                <h2>Predicting Rent Prices (Apr 2023 - May 2023)</h2>
              
								<p> The goal of the project was to recommend the top 5 ideal zip codes for a recent college graduate to live in, based on the difference between the median income level in the city and the predicted rent price. In this project, I transformed a data frame with 674 observations and 19 variables by identifying outliers and deciding whether to keep or remove them, as well as normalizing numerical values. To predict rent prices, I trained five different predictive models, including GLMnet, a neural network, random forest, and both radial and linear support vector machines. I evaluated each modelâ€™s performance based on the mean absolute error, mean squared error, and R-squared.</p>
